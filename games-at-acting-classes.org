- Wickey wickey wild wild west
No. of people:  8+
Rules:
- Everyone stands in a circle
- Eldest person yells wickey wickey wild wild west, and turns towards one of their adjacent players, hits their own thigh facing into the circle and shouts Yeehaw
- This YeeHaw travels along the circle in the same direction in which it was started, i.e, the person towards whow our initiator sent their YeeHaw, will now hit their own thigh and send it to the next person and so on
- The YeeHaw completes a full circle, after which new interesting rules can apply
- Instead of transferring a YeeHaw, you can choose to be a Sheriff by showing a phantom badge and saying with a swag that you are a sheriff at that point. The response to this is that the last person who was YeeHaw'ing should now YeeHaw in the opposite direction
- Or you can choose to become a Hay-Barn, by doing a half squat and putting your hands above your head (as if you are about to jump up into a ballet dance routine). When you do this, the YeeHaw skips you, and the person next to you and the person next to them should now continue with YeeHaw in the same direction. They cannot sheriff it.
- Or you can do a Lasso, by throwing a phantom lasson at a person who is not on either side of you. When you do this the person who recieved the Lasso should start YeeHaw'ing in either direction.
- If someone mistakes, they sit down and become a part of the audience
- The last two remaining people participate in a Gun Down
- They stand with their backs towards each other
- Audience chooses a topic, such as Fruits
- With every shout of a name from the category of topic, the revellers take one step forward
- If someone changes a topic, to say Country, by shouting the word 'Country', they should turn and shoot at each other mouthing a Country name.
- The first one to shoot a correct name wins.
